# Tech & Ride eCommerce Site

## Motivation
The **Tech & Ride eCommerce Site** was built to showcase a practical and responsive front-end eCommerce application. The primary motivation behind this project was to strengthen skills in ReactJS, state management, responsive design, and component-based architecture. The site represents a company that sells a variety of tech products, including computers, smartphones, motorcycles, and tablets. This project highlights core features such as dynamic routing, shopping cart functionality, product details pages, and an accessible, user-friendly interface.

The project also integrates modern tools like Material UI for styling, Framer Motion for animations, and Vite as the build tool, demonstrating the usage of popular libraries and efficient development practices.
